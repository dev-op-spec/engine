# Implementation details
To streamline dev efforts, the opctl project is maintained as a monorepo containing semi-independent sub-projects.

Typically at a minimum, each sub-project includes it's own `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and`.opspec`. 

The project is configured as a single go module, which allows dependencies to be shared during development, and should allow most IDEs to understand the project configuration without manual configuration.

# Local development with native go tooling

First, ensure dependencies are installed

- [go 1.15](https://golang.org/doc/go1.15)
- [gpgme](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/) (on macOS, `brew install gpgme`)
- [dlv](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) (for debugging) - Because this project uses go modules, install this globally with `go get github.com/go-delve/delve` to run the tool outside of the project directory.

Build a binary with

`go build -o opctl-beta ./cli`

To debug

`go run github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv --check-go-version=false --listen=127.0.0.1:40000 --headless=true --api-version=2 exec /PATH/TO/OPCTL/opctl-beta run dev`

This will suspend execution until a client connects on port 40000. If using VSCode, you can use the saved run configuration to connect.

On macOS, you can debug exit signal handling by sending an interrupt to the underlying PID. When the debugger connects, it will give you the with a message like: `Got a connection, launched process ../opctl/opctl-beta (pid = 79924).` (path to process and PID will be different). Kill with `kill -SIGINT 72958`.
