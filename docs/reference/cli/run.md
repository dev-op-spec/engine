## `run [OPTIONS] PKG_REF`

Start and wait on an op

> if a node isn't running, one will be automatically created

## Arguments

### `PKG_REF`

Package reference (either `relative/path`, `/absolute/path`,
`host/path/repo#tag` (since v0.1.19), or `host/path/repo#tag/path`
(since v0.1.24))

## Options

### `-a`

Explicitly pass args to op in format `-a NAME1=VALUE1 -a NAME2=VALUE2`

### `--arg-file` *default: `.opspec/args.yml`* (since v0.1.19)

Read in a file of args in yml format

## Examples

### local pkg ref w/out args

```shell
opctl run myop
```

### remote pkg ref w/ args (must be installed first)

```shell
opctl run -a apiToken="my-token" -a channelName="my-channel" -a msg="hello!" github.com/opspec-pkgs/slack.chat.post-message#0.1.1
```

## Notes

### pkg source username/password prompt

If auth w/ the pkg source fails the cli will (re)prompt for username &
password.

> in non-interactive terminals, the cli will note that it can't prompt
> due to being in a non-interactive terminal and exit with a non zero
> exit code.

### input sources

Input sources are checked according to the following precedence:

- arg provided via `-a` option
- arg file (since v0.1.19)
- env var
- default
- prompt

### input prompts

Inputs which are invalid or missing will result in the cli prompting for
them.

> in non-interactive terminals, the cli will provide details about the
> invalid or missing input, note that it's giving up due to being in a
> non-interactive terminal and exit with a non zero exit code.

example:

```shell

-
  Please provide value for parameter.
  Name: version
  Description: version of app being compiled
-
```

#### validation (since v0.1.15)

When inputs don't meet constraints, the cli will (re)prompt for the
input until a satisfactory value is obtained.

### containers

#### image

##### image layer caching

All pulled image layers will be cached

##### image updates (since v0.1.22)

Prior to container creation, updates to the referenced image will be
pulled and applied.

If checking for or applying updated image layers fails, graceful
fallback to cached image layers will occur

#### networking

All containers created by opctl will be attached to a single managed
network.

> the network is visible from `docker network ls` as `opctl`.

#### cleanup

Containers will be removed as they exit.
