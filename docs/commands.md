## `opctl`

### Options

#### `--no-color` (since v0.1.15)

To disable color, include a `--no-color` flag w/ your
command.
> this may increase readability in environments not supporting
> color escape codes or piping output to another program

##### Examples

```sh
opctl --no-color events
```

#### `-h` or `--help`

For context specific help, include a `-h` (or `--help`) flag w/ your
command.

##### Examples

```sh
opctl node create -h

Usage: opctl node create

Creates a node
```

## `opctl events`

listen to node events.

> if a node isn't running, one will be automatically created.


### Examples

#### Event Replay
Events are persisted to disk and can be replayed (since v0.1.15).
> events are not held across node restarts; any time a node starts it
> clears its event db.

1. open terminal & run an op so we have some events
   ```sh
   opctl run github.com/opspec-pkgs/uuid.v4.generate#1.1.0
   ```

1. exit terminal
   ```sh
   exit
   ```

1. re open terminal & replay events
   ```sh
   opctl run events
   ```

#### Event Streaming
Events are streamed in realtime as they occur. They can be streamed in parallel to any number of terminals.
> behind the scenes, events are delivered over websockets

1. open multiple terminals & open event stream on each
   ```sh
   opctl events
   ```

1. open another terminal & run an op; watch events show up on all terminals simultaneously in real-time
   ```sh
   opctl run some-op
   ```

## `opctl ls [DIR_REF]`

List ops in a directory.

### Arguments

#### `DIR_REF` *default: `.opspec`* (since v0.1.24)

Reference to dir ops will be listed from (either `relative/path`, `/absolute/path`, `host/path/repo#tag` (since v0.1.19), or `host/path/repo#tag/path` (since v0.1.24))

### Examples

#### `.opspec` dir

lists ops from `./.opspec`

```sh
opctl ls
```

#### remote dir

lists ops from [github.com/opctl/opctl#0.1.24](https://github.com/opctl/opctl/tree/0.1.24)

```sh
opctl ls github.com/opctl/opctl#0.1.24/
```

## `opctl run [OPTIONS] OP_REF`

Start and wait on an op

> if a node isn't running, one will be automatically created

### Arguments

#### `OP_REF`

Op reference (either `relative/path`, `/absolute/path`, `host/path/repo#tag` (since v0.1.19), or `host/path/repo#tag/path` (since v0.1.24))

### Options

#### `-a`

Explicitly pass args to op in format `-a NAME1=VALUE1 -a NAME2=VALUE2`

#### `--arg-file` *default: `.opspec/args.yml`* (since v0.1.19)

Read in a file of args in yml format

### Examples

#### local op ref w/out args

```sh
opctl run myop
```

#### remote op ref w/ args

```sh
opctl run -a apiToken="my-token" -a channelName="my-channel" -a msg="hello!" github.com/opspec-pkgs/slack.chat.post-message#0.1.1
```

### Notes

#### op source username/password prompt

If auth w/ the op source fails the cli will (re)prompt for username &
password.

> in non-interactive terminals, the cli will note that it can't prompt
> due to being in a non-interactive terminal and exit with a non zero
> exit code.

#### input sources

Input sources are checked according to the following precedence:

- arg provided via `-a` option
- arg file (since v0.1.19)
- env var
- default
- prompt

#### input prompts

Inputs which are invalid or missing will result in the cli prompting for
them.

> in non-interactive terminals, the cli will provide details about the
> invalid or missing input, note that it's giving up due to being in a
> non-interactive terminal and exit with a non zero exit code.

example:

```sh

-
  Please provide value for parameter.
  Name: version
  Description: version of app being compiled
-
```

##### validation (since v0.1.15)

When inputs don't meet constraints, the cli will (re)prompt for the
input until a satisfactory value is obtained.

#### containers

##### image

###### image layer caching

All pulled image layers will be cached

###### image updates (since v0.1.22)

Prior to container creation, updates to the referenced image will be
pulled and applied.

If checking for or applying updated image layers fails, graceful
fallback to cached image layers will occur

##### networking

All containers created by opctl will be attached to a single managed
network.

> the network is visible from `docker network ls` as `opctl`.

##### cleanup

Containers will be removed as they exit.

## `opctl node create` (since v0.1.15)

Create an in-process node which inherits current
stderr/stdout/stdin/PGId (process group id) and blocks until killed.

> There can be only one node running at a time on a given machine.

### Options

#### `--data-dir` (since v0.1.25)
Path of dir used to store node data

### Notes

#### lockfile

Upon creation, nodes populate a lockfile at `DATA_DIR/lockfile.pid`
containing their PId (process id).

#### concurrency

Prior to node creation, if a lockfile exists, the existing lock holder
will be liveness tested.

Only in the event the existing lock holder is dead will creation of a
new node occur.

#### debugging

Debugging can be accomplished by running `node create` from a terminal
where it's output is easily monitored.

#### cleanup

During creation, `DATA_DIR` will be
cleaned of any existing events, ops, and temp files/dirs to ensure
the created node starts from a clean slate.

## `opctl node kill` (since v0.1.15)

Kill the running node.

## `opctl op create [OPTIONS] NAME` (since v0.1.15)

Creates an op

### Arguments

#### `NAME`
Name of the op

### Options

#### `-d` or `--description`
Description of the op

#### `--path` *default: `.opspec`*

### Examples

```sh
opctl op create -d "my awesome op description" --path some/path my-awesome-op-name

## `op install [OPTIONS] OP_REF` (since v0.1.19)
