title: Rangeable value
---

A rangable value is a value that can be iterated through. A rangable value can be an [array](../types/array.md), an [object](../types/object.md), or a [variable reference](variable-reference) to a rangeable value.

While iterating though a rangeable value, [loop variables](loop-vars) can be used to reference the values of the items being looped through.
