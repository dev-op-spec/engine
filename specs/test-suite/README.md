# Problem Statement

Language agnostic test suite for implementations

# Usage

Scenarios are organized hierarchically mimicking the structure of an op as closely as possible to ease
maintenance/discoverability

Each scenario is an op.

Ops containing a scenarios.yml file implement one or more test
scenarios (see [scenarios.schema.json](scenarios.schema.json) for schema)
